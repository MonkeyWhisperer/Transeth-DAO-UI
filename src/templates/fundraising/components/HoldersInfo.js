          The token holders are the accounts contributing to the fundraising
          campaign. They are represented through a custom bonded-token and a
          voting app. They hold most of the governance rights over the
          organization.

          transferred to the council each month.

          This architecture grants most of the governance rights to token
          holders, to protect their contribution. However, this also requires
          the organization to be able to mitigate situations where a token
          holder could own the whole organization by owning more than 50% of the
          shares.

          css={`

          This is why token holder votes, where most of the organizationâ€™s
          decisions are made, can only be opened and initiated by the council.
