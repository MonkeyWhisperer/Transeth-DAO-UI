# Transeth-DAO-UI

Source code for https://dao.transeth.org

Install it:

```
git clone 
cd path to clone
yarn install
```

The easiest is to run it connected to rinkeby, and create a testing organization. It requires an internet connection, but it doesnâ€™t require to setup anything else (local Ethereum / IPFS nodes).

Run it:

```
yarn start:rinkeby
```
