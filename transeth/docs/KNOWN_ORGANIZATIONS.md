# Known organizations

Want to have your organization’s swanky cool name and logo show up in the Client instead of an identicon? Just follow these steps!

1. Add your organization’s icon (preferably as an [optimized SVG](https://github.com/svg/svgo) or [PNG](https://pngquant.org/)) to [`src/known-organizations/assets/`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/tree/master/src/known-organizations/images).
2. Go to [`src/known-organizations/index.js`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/blob/master/src/known-organizations/index.js) and add your organization to the Map.

All done! If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to [file an issue to ask for help](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues/new/choose)!
