For more information about Aragon-related security and contact information, please visit our [security policy page](https://wiki.aragon.org/association/security/).

## Status

The smart contracts underlying Aragon organizations have passed a number of [independent professional security audits](https://wiki.aragon.org/association/security/). Ongoing, rolling reviews are also conducted from time to time as new changes and releases are frozen.

There is an ongoing [bug bounty program](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/bug_bounty/) with a bounty pool of $250,000 USD for rewarding hackers who find new security vulnerabilities. [More information](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/bug_bounty/).
